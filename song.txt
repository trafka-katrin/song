Until the End of Days (оригинал Stratovarius)

Until the end of days [2x]

Fear is building lies like castles out of sand
An age of ignorance that I don't understand
Just hold on
If you can bend you can't be broken
You must hold on to your life

All the hatred in the world can break you down
Take your soul and grind you down into the ground
Just stay strong
What doesn't break you makes you stronger
Fight until the end of days

Seize the day
Come what may
Find your own way
Make the darkness fade away
Take a chance
Make your destiny
Take command
Let the whole world understand
This is where you'll make your stand
And hold on 'til the end of your days
Until the end of days

Now it's time to act, a time for bravery
Break the chains that hold us all in slavery
Just stay strong
What doesn't break you makes you stronger
Fight until the end of days

[2x]
Seize the day
Come what may
Find your own way
Make the darkness fade away
Take a chance
Make your destiny
Take command
Let the whole world understand
This is where you'll make your stand
And hold on 'til the end of your days
Until the end of days

Until the end of days [3x]
