Until the End of Days (оригинал Stratovarius)

Until the end of days [2x]

Fear is building lies like castles out of sand
An age of ignorance that I don't understand
Just hold on
If you can bend you can't be broken
You must hold on to your life

All the hatred in the world can break you down
Take your soul and grind you down into the ground
Just stay strong
What doesn't break you makes you stronger
Fight until the end of days
